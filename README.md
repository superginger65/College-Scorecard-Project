# College-Scorecard-Project
Determine what makes a good school and make actionable steps for Duquesne to become a better school.

## Description

This is a project I created in my Machine Learning class. I used the data from the Department of Education's College Scorecard survey to
decide what makes a school "good." I then found data that correlated, and used that to determine whether or not a school good by comparing 
their actual numbers with numbers that were predicted to be "good" based on it's other input variables. I could then make actionable suggestions
to Duquesne on how to make it more "good" based on real world and predicted data.
